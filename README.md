This repo is about deploying an Application using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
In this demo, an application source code is used to demonstrate a fully functional Jenkins pipeline with some really cool feautures that are used in production workload such as automating installation and configurations, code analaysis, automatic and manual approval in the pipeline, different APIs just as in a microservice app, the use of different servers for different API permits easy load balancing, scalability, availability and most of all easy troubleshooting.
